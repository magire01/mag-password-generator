<h1> Mark's Password Generator </h1>

<p> This website allows the user to generate a random password based on what length and characters they require. </p>

<p> The site will prompt the user for the "Password Length" and whether or not to include Lower Case letters, Upper Case Letters, Numbers, and Special Characters. Random characters will be selected from the character types the user agrees to.  </p>

<h3> Known Issues to be fixed </h3>
<ul> There is currently no logic in to include a character type just because the user selected it. It will not include character types the user refuses, but it is not guarenteed that the character type the user agrees to will be randomly selected and included in the password</ul>
<ul> The prompts start before the user clicks the "Generate Password" button. </ul>
<ul> There is no logic in place to stop a user from entering an invalid Password Length </ul>
<ul> There is no logic in place to require a user to select at least one character type</ul>
