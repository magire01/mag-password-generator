<h1> Mark's Password Generator </h1>

<p> This website allows the user to generate a random password based on what length and characters they require. </p>

<p> The site will prompt the user for the "Password Length" and whether or not to include Lower Case letters, Upper Case Letters, Numbers, and Special Characters. </p>

<p> The characters are generated randomly. There is a defect where there is no requirement to include a character type just because the user selected it. </p>
